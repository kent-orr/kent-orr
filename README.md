I'm Kent Orr. When I'm not applying data science techniques to ecommerce integrations I moonlight as the owner and operator of Pawpaw Analytics, ltd. which specializes in bringing data analysis and reporting to public and non-profit organizations. 

You can view my website and blog at [pawpawanalytics.com](https://www.pawpawanalytics.com/).
